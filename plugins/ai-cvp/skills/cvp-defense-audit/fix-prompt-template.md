# Fix prompt template

Phase 3. Fill every `{PLACEHOLDER}`, delete each `{IF_...}` line whose condition is false, and save the result next to the audit prompt as `<repo-name>-<date>-fix.md`. The user pastes it into a normal, unsandboxed session on an Opus-class model once the audit session has written its report.

## Placeholder notes

- `{REPORT_PATH}`, `{TEST_NAME_PATTERN}`, `{TEST_COMMAND}`, `{TOOLED_EXTENSIONS}`, `{CONTRACT_CHECK}`, and `{INFRA}`: the same values as the audit prompt. For several surfaces, list every report, its check, and its test command.
- `{EXPLICIT_SOURCES_STEP}`: only when the project file lists sources explicitly (recon item 10); otherwise delete the `{IF_EXPLICIT_SOURCES}` line. For XcodeGen: "run `xcodegen generate` whenever a test file enters or leaves the source tree". For an Xcode project without synchronized folders: "add a test file to the {TEST_TARGET} target when it enters the source tree, and remove the reference when it leaves".
- `{INTEGRATION_BRANCH}`: the branch PRs target, from recon item 13.
- `{CHECK_COMMANDS}`: the full test suite, lint, and typecheck, as the repo runs them (package scripts, Makefile, or CI workflow).
- `{CONVENTIONS}`: where the repo states its commit, PR, and review rules (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, a PR template). If nothing is written down, use "the style of recent commits and PRs".
- `{TRACKING_RULES}`: the file or section holding the repo's security-tracking rules, if any.

```text
The security audit of {NAME} is done. Its prompt asked for the report at
{REPORT_PATH}, one failing proof test per Confirmed finding
({TEST_NAME_PATTERN}) at docs/security/tests/<the repo-relative path it runs
from>.disabled, and any harness scripts and logs in docs/security/harness/.
Audits don't always keep to that layout, so step 1 checks it. Git ignores
docs/security/. This session isn't sandboxed. Verify the findings, help me
choose what to fix, and fix only what I pick.

## Rules
- Commit, push, or open a PR only after I say so. Follow {CONVENTIONS}.
- Run read-only checks against {INFRA} only after I OK each one. Don't change
  live settings or data.
- Never commit anything under docs/security/, and never force-add it. The
  report and archived tests stay local. Proof tests fail by design, so one
  enters the source tree only together with its fix.
- Don't print secret values. Cite them by path and line.
{IF_EXPLICIT_SOURCES: "- This project lists its sources explicitly, so {EXPLICIT_SOURCES_STEP}."}

## 1. Read and normalize
- Check that git ignores docs/security/, with
  `git check-ignore -q docs/security/probe`. If it exits non-zero, append
  `/docs/security/` to the file `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude` prints,
  and tell me. Don't edit .gitignore.
- Run `git status`. It should list nothing. Move any cvp test or helper it
  lists into docs/security/tests/ as described below. Show me any other change
  before doing anything else.
- List `find docs/security -type f`, then run this check, which should print
  nothing: `{CONTRACT_CHECK}`
  If it prints files, normalize them:
  - The report is {REPORT_PATH}. If that file doesn't exist, move the newest
    .md file directly under docs/security/ there.
  - Move each proof test, helper, or fixture to docs/security/tests/<the
    repo-relative path it runs from>.disabled. A file stored by name only, or
    relative to a test target's folder, belongs under that folder; check the
    project config. Update the test paths the report cites.
  - Move other audit files, such as harness scripts and logs, to
    docs/security/harness/.
  - Tell me which file is the report and what moved, from where to where,
    then run the check again.
- Whatever the check printed, append `.disabled` to any file in
  docs/security/harness/ that ends in {TOOLED_EXTENSIONS}, and tell me.
- Read the report and every proof test it cites. From here on, use the
  report's own finding IDs.
{IF_TRACKING_RULES: "- Read {TRACKING_RULES} and follow them for every report update."}

## 2. Verify the findings
Run each proof test here, outside the sandbox: copy it, and any archived
helper it imports, from docs/security/tests/ to its source path without
`.disabled`, run it with `{TEST_COMMAND}`, then delete the copies. Check that
it fails for the reason the report gives, not because of a missing mock,
network access, or setup. If it passes, or fails for another reason, downgrade
the finding to Unconfirmed and say why. Read the code path yourself before you
accept a severity.
- For each test the audit skipped, or ran only through an alternative
  harness, because of the sandbox: run it through the real project with the
  command the report gives. Make sure it actually runs: the run's test count
  must include it, and a run that executes no tests proves nothing.
- Try to settle Unconfirmed or Plausible findings with local tests, such as a
  loopback listener standing in for a remote server or a read of the system
  log. Never test against real servers.

## 3. Settle what the code couldn't
For each item the report says to check in {INFRA}, propose the exact check: the
dashboard page, CLI command, or provider setting to look at, and which result
means the finding is real. Run read-only CLI checks only after I OK them. I'll
do the dashboard checks and tell you what I see.

## 4. Triage
Show a table: ID, severity, verified (yes, no, or downgraded), effort (S, M, or
L), and proposed grouping. Group related findings, such as ones that share a
root cause or a fix, into one change. Then ask which to fix. Fix nothing I
don't pick.

## 5. Fix
For each change I pick:
- Branch from {INTEGRATION_BRANCH}.
- Restore the proof test of each finding in the change, and any archived
  helper it imports: move it from docs/security/tests/ to its source path
  without `.disabled`, which also removes the archived copy:
  `mv docs/security/tests/<path>.disabled <path>`
  Run it and confirm it fails. Then fix the code until it passes.
- Keep it as the regression test. Rename it if the repo's naming convention
  doesn't fit {TEST_NAME_PATTERN}.
- Run the full test suite, lint, and typecheck: {CHECK_COMMANDS}.
- Before committing, check that `git status` lists no docs/security/ paths
  and no proof tests other than the ones this change fixes.
- Show me the diff, and wait for my OK before committing.

## 6. Update the report
For each finding, record its status, the date, the commits or PR, and how the
fix was verified. Keep "fixed on a branch", "merged", and "deployed" distinct.
Don't mark a finding deployed until I confirm it is.

## 7. When the fixes have merged
Tell me to run /cvp-defense-audit again. Its recon reads the updated report and
adds a retest section for the fixed IDs.
