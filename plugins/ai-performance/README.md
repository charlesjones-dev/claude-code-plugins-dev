## üéØ What This Plugin Does

Provides a complete suite of AI-powered performance tools including commands, agents, and skills that help you build high-performance applications, detect bottlenecks, optimize resource usage, and maintain performance best practices throughout your development lifecycle.

### Why Use This Plugin?

While you can manually review code for performance issues, this plugin provides structured, comprehensive performance analysis:

‚ùå **Manual performance review challenges:**

- Difficult to track improvements over time
- Hard to prioritize optimization efforts

This plugin enhances performance analysis by providing:

‚úÖ **Custom analysis templates** - Define exactly what your audit should cover
‚úÖ **Controlled output location** - Reports saved to `/docs/performance/{timestamp}-performance-audit.md` (timestamp prevents overwrites)
‚úÖ **Reproducible audits** - Same comprehensive format every time
‚úÖ **Standardized documentation** - Consistent audit reports across all projects
‚úÖ **Timestamped tracking** - Easy to compare audits and measure improvements over time
‚úÖ **Enterprise-ready** - Professional audit documents suitable for performance reviews

**Use this plugin for:** Formal performance audits, optimization planning, and repeatable performance assessments

## üìã Available Commands

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The `/performance-audit` command uses Claude Code's specialized **performance-optimizer agent** to perform comprehensive performance analysis:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Scans source files for performance anti-patterns
   - Analyzes database query patterns and data access strategies
   - Reviews async/await implementation
   - Checks memory allocation patterns

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Identifies N+1 query problems
   - Detects synchronous blocking operations
   - Finds large object allocations
   - Locates missing caching opportunities
   - Checks for inefficient LINQ queries

3. **Report Generation**
   - Categorizes findings by impact (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Provides exact locations with file paths and line numbers
   - Includes code examples and optimization guidance
   - Creates prioritized optimization roadmap
   - Saves timestamped report to /docs/performance folder

The specialized agent brings deep performance expertise and pattern recognition capabilities to identify bottlenecks that might be missed by manual review.
