# AI-Security Plugin

**Comprehensive AI-powered security toolkit for Claude Code.** Intelligent security scanning, vulnerability detection, threat analysis, and secure development guidance.

---

## üéØ What This Plugin Does

Provides a complete suite of AI-powered security tools including commands, agents, and skills that help you build secure applications, detect vulnerabilities, analyze threats, and maintain security best practices throughout your development lifecycle.

### Why Not Just Use `/security-review`?

Claude Code ships with a native `/security-review` command that provides basic security analysis. However, it has limitations:

‚ùå **No custom scan templates** - You can't define what the report should include
‚ùå **No output file control** - Results appear in chat but aren't saved to a specific location
‚ùå **No reproducibility** - Each scan produces different output formats
‚ùå **No standardization** - Can't ensure consistent audit documentation across projects

This plugin enhances security scanning by providing:

‚úÖ **Custom scan templates** - Define exactly what your audit should cover
‚úÖ **Controlled output location** - Reports saved to `/docs/security/{timestamp}-security-audit.md` (timestamp prevents overwrites)
‚úÖ **Reproducible audits** - Same comprehensive format every time
‚úÖ **Standardized documentation** - Consistent audit reports across all projects
‚úÖ **Timestamped tracking** - Easy to compare audits over time
‚úÖ **Enterprise-ready** - Professional audit documents suitable for compliance

**Use `/security-review` for:** Quick ad-hoc security checks during development

**Use `/security-audit` for:** Formal security audits, compliance documentation, and repeatable security assessments

## üìã Available Commands

### `/security-audit`

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The `/security-audit` command uses Claude Code's specialized **security-auditor agent** to perform comprehensive security analysis:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Scans source files for security anti-patterns
   - Analyzes authentication and authorization flows
   - Reviews configuration files for misconfigurations
   - Checks dependency packages for known vulnerabilities

2. **Pattern Detection**
   - Identifies SQL injection vectors
   - Detects XSS vulnerabilities
   - Finds authentication bypass opportunities
   - Locates hardcoded secrets
   - Checks for missing authorization

3. **Report Generation**
   - Categorizes findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Provides exact locations with file paths and line numbers
   - Includes code examples and remediation guidance
   - Creates prioritized remediation roadmap
   - Saves timestamped report to /docs/security folder

The specialized agent brings deep security expertise and pattern recognition capabilities to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by manual review.

## üéì Best Practices

### When to Run Security Audits

- ‚úÖ Before production deployments
- ‚úÖ After implementing authentication/authorization features
- ‚úÖ When adding new API endpoints
- ‚úÖ After integrating third-party libraries
- ‚úÖ During security reviews and compliance checks
- ‚úÖ As part of CI/CD pipeline (automated security gates)

### How to Use Audit Results

1. **Prioritize Critical & High findings** - Address these immediately
2. **Review code context** - Understand why each finding is a risk
3. **Apply remediation examples** - Use provided code fixes as templates
4. **Test fixes thoroughly** - Ensure security patches don't break functionality
5. **Re-audit after fixes** - Verify vulnerabilities are resolved

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Savings

**Per security audit:**

- Manual security review: ~4-8 hours (for medium-sized codebase)
- With security-audit: ~2-3 minutes (AI-powered analysis)

**Estimated savings:**

- Per comprehensive audit: Save ~4-8 hours
- Per month (2 audits): Save ~8-16 hours
- Per year: Save ~100+ hours

Plus reduced security incident risk and faster vulnerability remediation.
