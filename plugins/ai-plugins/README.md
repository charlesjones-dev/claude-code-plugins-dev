# AI Plugins

AI-powered plugin development tools for Claude Code. This plugin provides intelligent scaffolding and generation capabilities to help you quickly create new Claude Code plugins with proper structure, metadata, and commands.

## Features

- **Interactive Scaffolding**: Ask questions to gather plugin requirements
- **Automatic Structure Generation**: Create proper directory structure and metadata files
- **Smart Command Generation**: Generate command templates with clear instructions
- **Marketplace Integration**: Automatically register new plugins in marketplace.json
- **Best Practices**: Follow Claude Code plugin conventions and patterns

## Available Commands

### `/scaffold-plugin`

Interactively scaffold a new Claude Code plugin with AI assistance.

**What it does:**
- Asks questions about your plugin (name, description, category, commands)
- Creates the complete plugin directory structure
- Generates metadata files (plugin.json)
- Creates command templates with instructions
- Optionally generates README and LICENSE files
- Registers the plugin in the marketplace

**Example usage:**

```bash
/scaffold-plugin
```

**Interactive flow:**

1. **Plugin Name**: Enter the plugin name in kebab-case (e.g., "my-awesome-plugin")
2. **Description**: Provide a brief description of your plugin's purpose
3. **Category**: Choose from AI & Automation, Productivity, Code Quality, DevOps, Development Tools, or Security
4. **Commands**: Select which commands to include (main, helper, or custom)
5. **Features**: Choose additional features (README, LICENSE, test command)

The command will then:
- Create the plugin directory structure
- Generate all necessary files
- Register the plugin in the marketplace
- Provide next steps for customization

**Generated structure:**

```
plugins/your-plugin-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude-plugin/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugin.json          # Plugin metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ your-command.md       # Command implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Plugin documentation
â””â”€â”€ LICENSE                   # MIT license
```
