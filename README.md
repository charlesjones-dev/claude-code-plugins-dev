Claude Code plugins for code audits, release checks and day-to-day git and project workflows. There are 17 plugins; each adds its own slash commands, so install only the ones you need.

## Available Plugins

> **Usage note:** Each skill is a slash command, for example `/accessibility-audit`. Interactive skills ask for what they need; the rest run directly on your codebase. A few take flags, such as `/seo-fix --dry-run` and `/swift-verify --fix`. See each plugin's README.

> **Note on audit plugins:** The audit plugins read your code and report what they find, and a few can also check a live URL. Use them to catch problems during development, then confirm with runtime testing and manual review.

## Quick Start

[Install Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) first.

1. Add this marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add charlesjones-dev/claude-code-plugins-dev
```

2. Install the plugins you want from the table above:

```
/plugin install <plugin-name>@claude-code-plugins-dev

# For example:
/plugin install ai-git@claude-code-plugins-dev
/plugin install ai-security@claude-code-plugins-dev
```

3. Run any of the plugin's slash commands:

```
/git-init              # Generate a .gitignore for the project
/security-init         # Add file-access deny rules for secrets
/ado-init              # Set up Azure DevOps and its MCP server
```

## Deprecated & Removed

As Claude Code ships features natively, plugins and skills that duplicate them are retired here. Removed plugins and skills live on in git history.

| Item | Status | Superseded by | Details |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| ai-learn (`/learn`, `/learn-review`) | 🗑️ Removed (July 2026) | Native **Learning** output style (`/config` → "Output style" → "Learning") | Built-in collaborative mentor mode with `TODO(human)` markers; an **Explanatory** style also ships natively |
| ai-workflow `/workflow-plan-phases` | 🗑️ Removed (July 2026, v2.0.0) | Native **Dynamic Workflows** | JavaScript runtime orchestrating subagent fan-out with per-agent token budgets; replaces manual 30–50k-token phase sizing |
| ai-workflow `/workflow-implement-phases` | 🗑️ Removed (July 2026, v2.0.0) | Native **Dynamic Workflows** | Runtime-managed orchestration replaces manual `Task()` fan-out and phase-coordination bookkeeping |
